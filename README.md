# Car-Simulator
This is my personal project that started in December 2023

This program uses advanced calculations to work out theoretical performance specs
This application will not be 100% accurate as it is only theoretical and Theory can only take you so far
The independent variables can be adjusted to more accurately replicate the conditions the car was tested in
NOTE: What manufactures say their cars can do are not necessarily untrue, however it was likley achieved in very specific conditions
